# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
The Self Care Center is a web application that allows the user to randomly generate either an affirmation or a mantra at the click of the button. This is a well-being focused application that features soothing colors and smooth styling intended to be relaxing to the user. Selections can be made using a pair of radio buttons, and a new affirmation or mantra is generated every time the "Receive Message" button is clicked. The user will be alerted with a small but noticeable popup if they try to generate a message without first selecting whether they would like to receive a mantra or an affirmation. Once the message has been generated, the user can click "Clear Message" which will remove the current message and replace it with the original meditation icon.
